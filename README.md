# A websocket server and client that enables chat-room functionality in the terminal
   * lightweight terminal chatroom
   * users join the server directly via running the websocket client.rb file from terminal

## Client
### client.rb
   * requires 'websocket-client-simple' (gem install) and 'io/console' (built in)
   * connects to the server and handles outgoing/incoming messages via default $stdin and $stdout (STDIN, STDOUT)
   * script is minimal and currently supports options to show/hide input via activating noecho
   * next steps would be to either access terminal's input field from the script or use a modified gui. Ideally, we want users to be able to build strings in the terminal without the display interfering
   * To use, the ip:port needs to be altered


## Server
### server.rb
   * initializes an empty 'chatroom' instance when started
   * new websocket connections are linked to 'member' instances
   * the majority of work is done in the 'chatroom' instance, with the server only routing the events it is listening for
   * outside of printing to console while server is running, (and what is left in the terminal buffer), no traffic is logged to an external file
